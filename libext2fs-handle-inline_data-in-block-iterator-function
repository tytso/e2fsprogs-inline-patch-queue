libext2fs: handle inline_data in block iterator function

From: Zheng Liu <wenqing.lz@taobao.com>

We needn't traverse blocks for an inode which has inline data because no block
belongs to it.  After appling this patch, the following commands in debugfs can
handle inline_data feature:
	- icheck
	- blocks
	- filefrag

In some places, block iterator functions are used to traverse blocks of
directory.  In this case, we need to check whether inode has inline_data flag or
not, and handle it manually.
